This bot extends the starter kit from [here](https://github.com/Ethiopia-COVID19/covid-19-bot-starter-kit) 
 > **Note:**  Optionally, the data collected by the bot can be pushed to Google spreadsheet. To enable this functionality ```google-spreadsheet``` package is used ([more detail](https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-spreadsheet)). Take a look at the ```.env``` file to turn this on/off. You also need to set up a Google project & enable the sheets API ([more detail](https://theoephraim.github.io/node-google-spreadsheet/#/getting-started/authentication))
